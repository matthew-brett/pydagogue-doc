pydagogue sphinx doc hosting
===========================

This repo is used to host builds of the pydagogue sphinx doc. The actual code
is in a `separate repo <http://github.com/matthew-brett/pydagogue>`_.

How to build sphinx docs
------------------------

To make a new build, simply go to the doc directory and type
::
    $ make gh-pages

or equivalently
::
    $ ./gh-pages.py

This will create a new build of the docs tagged by 'git describe'. To
make something tagged with 'current', simply do
::
    $ ./gh-pages.py current

It may be a good idea to simply use 'current' for any builds of current
development that haven't been tagged.
